# Delhi-AQI-Analysis
Delhi AQI Analysis | ShadowFox Task 2 (Intermediate)
In-depth analysis of Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) using Python to study pollution trends, key pollutants, and seasonal variations through data visualization.

This project analyzes air quality trends in Delhi using pollutant concentration data. Key pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 were analyzed to study seasonal variations, identify major pollution contributors, and derive an approximate AQI indicator. The analysis includes statistical insights and visualizations to understand air pollution patterns and their public health impact.
